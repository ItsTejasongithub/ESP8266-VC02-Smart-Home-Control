# ESP8266 VC02 Smart Home Control

This project demonstrates how to customize the firmware for **ESP8266** microcontroller to control devices like fans and lights, using serial communication and integrating the **AI Thinker VC02** module. The system supports both manual control through physical switches and automated control via received commands.

## Features
- **Fan and Light Control**: Turn on/off fan and light using received commands.
- **Switch Control**: Manually control fan and light states with physical switches connected to ESP8266 GPIO pins.
- **VC02 Integration**: Uses the **AI Thinker VC02** module to enable wireless control via serial communication (UART).
- **Customizable Firmware**: Easily customize the firmware to add more devices or modify commands.

## Components
- **ESP8266** Microcontroller
- **AI Thinker VC02** Wi-Fi module
- **Relay/Control Circuit** for fan and light control
- **Push Button Switches** for manual control
- **Serial Communication** for command reception
